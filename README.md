# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
A Python script that analyses sentiment on a given topic from tweets data provided by Twitter

</br>

## Getting Started

The project requires authentication via the Twitter API. A new application needs to be created to get the necessary keys. A few libraries also need to be installed for the script to run properly.

### Prerequisites

* [Tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org), the official Python library for accessing the Twitter API
* [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/), a Python library for processing textual data
* [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org) dataset, to help better natural language processing
* Keys from the [Twitter Developer Application Management](https://apps.twitter.com/) site
  - Consumer key
  - Consumer secret
  - Access token
  - Access token secret
  
### Installing

The **Tweepy** library can be installed by using the command
```
pip3 install tweepy
```  
</br>

The **TextBlob** library can be installed using
```
pip3 install textblob
```  
</br>

The **NLTK corpora** can be downloaded by using the following command
```
python3 -m textblob.download_corpora
```
These files will provide better natural language processing capabilites for the TextBlob library. 

> **Note:** A missing cerificate error can arise when trying to download the NLTK corpus files. To fix the issue, navigate to the Python folder `/Applications/Python 3.6` and run the `Install Certificates.command` file.

</br>

To obtain the **consumer keys** and **access tokens** from the Twitter Dev Application Management site, a new app needs to be created using a Twitter account.

* Open [apps.twitter.com](https://apps.twitter.com/) and use the `Create New App` button.
* Complete the form with the necessary application details. The application name must be unique.
* Navitgate to the `Keys and Access Tokens` tab.
* Copy `Consumer Key`, `Consumer Secret`, `Access Token` and `Access Token Secret` and update the variables `consumer_key`, `consumer_secret`, `access_token`, and `access_token_secret` in the `sentiment_analysis.py` file accordingly.

</br>

## Running the program

* Download the `sentiment_analysis.py` file from the repository
* Update the consumer keys and access token values with the appropriate data in the file
* Run the file using
```
python3 sentiment_analysis.py
```

</br>

## Sample output
